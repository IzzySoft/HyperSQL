Known issues and limitations
============================

- if two objects have the same name (e.g. a table and its synonym), the dependency graph cannot tell them apart
  (same for where/what used currently)
- filtering "/* block comments */" on parameter parse doesn't filter "/* nested /* comments */ */" correctly
- used_by for types not always recognized (e.g. not in RETURNS of functions, with "PIPE ROW( <type>",
  or when used by other types)
- some pages might not render correctly in MSIE, which sometimes runs in "compatibility mode" (especially on
  Intranet sites). HyperSQL tries to snap it out of that via the "X-UA-Compatible" Meta tag, but MSIE does
  not always honor that â€“ nothing HyperSQL can do about that. If you're running into that issue, please
  see https://stackoverflow.com/a/16365626/2533433 for a work-around (in short: have your web server send
  the same setting with the HTTP headers).


Known, but intended:
--------------------

- @used/@uses are added to JavaDoc, but not to depency links. They are intended to point to "outside resources".
- doesn't match full-qualified names between code and JavaDoc (e.g. "table_name" and "schema.table_name").
  Consider this intended, as code might cover multiple database schemata and thus mappings are not clear
  by default.
