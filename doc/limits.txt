Known issues and limitations
============================

- stand-alone procedures/functions (i.e. those not part of any package) are not dealt with
- if two objects have the same name (e.g. a table and its synonym), the dependency graph cannot tell them apart
  (same for where/what used currently)
- if the parameter list of an object (e.g. "PROCEDURE foobar (<parameter_list>)") contains comments,
  parameter parsing stops at that place (i.e. parameters following the comment are not recognized, and
  thus reported by JavaDoc verification as mismatch in parameter count)
- used_by for types not always recognized (e.g. not in RETURNS of functions, with "PIPE ROW( <type>",
  or when used by other types)
- @used/@uses are added to JavaDoc, but not to depency links. They are intended to point to "outside resources".
