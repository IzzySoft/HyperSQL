TO-DO LIST
==========
* C++ files need doxygen hyperlinks for where used pages
* Scan Java files for where used
* Handle Types
* Naming of objects HTML files: Switch from <filename>_<uid>.html to e.g.
  <filepath_with_replaced_separators>_<filename>.html to make "steady links"
  possible
* JavaDoc verification for stand-alone objects
* @ignore only ignores javadoc verification. Do we need some @unlist tag to exclude objects
  completely from being listed?
