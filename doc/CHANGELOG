# History of Changes for HyperSQL

v1.7.0
-------------------
+ option blind_offset added (to control parsing for "anonymous JavaDoc segments")
* code reorganization: outsourced some code to modules (hyperjdoc, hypercore, hypercode)
+ "describing" JavaDoc elements (with just one "text" option) can now span multiple lines
! converting crash when configured top_level_directory did not exist into a
  standard exit with proper error message
! fixed the additional empty lines in code listings
+ new keyword include_source (section Process) to make the inclusion of source
  code optional

v1.6.0 (20.02.2010)
-------------------
+ added javadoc tag @license
+ missing details added to package info
! some where_used were not found since their lines were considered "having not
  enough touples" (<2). Disabled that check for now - considering to make it
  an option in the future
* reorganized configuration and prepared it for some new features planned
+ new keyword project_info_file in the configurations General section (additional
  content for the start page)
+ added possibility to deactivate unwanted pages
+ Index Page names (as appearing in the links)  now are configurable

v1.5.0 (16.02.2010)
-------------------
+ added Javadoc parsing and creating of Javadoc documentation
+ added some more configuration options
+ added more documentation (especially for Javadoc and configuration)
! some formatting issues fixed
* reworked main index (startpage)

v1.3.0 (10.02.2010)
-------------------
+ adding more code comments for better code documentation
+ adding apidoc (doc/apidoc/*), including a tiny shell script to generate it
+ added very basic syntax highlighting to the (SQL) source code presentation
! source code had been included into the page without escaping HTML chars,
  which sometimes lead to strange behavior in the browser

v1.2 (10.02.2010)
-----------------
+ improved config parser: now the .ini file does not have to contain all keywords
+ implemented fallback on search for the config file. Now searches for the
  project specific file (the new optional command line parameter + '.ini') first,
  then lowercase filename, then HyperSQL.ini (plus lowercase), and finally falls
  back to internally defined defaults

v1.1 (09.02.2010)
-----------------
* updated version by Izzy
+ configuration moved into .ini file
+ optional command line parameter to specify the project (and hence the .ini used)
* completely reworked look-and-feel of the HTML pages created (javadoc like)

v1.0 (09.2001)
-----------------
* initial version by Randy
